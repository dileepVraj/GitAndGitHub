To view files in bash we can use the 'cat' 'less' 'tail', 'head' commands where cat command shows all contents of file in single
page, and less command is more advanced which gives us ability to paginate through the file in pages,
by using 'less fileName' we will able to view the content of file in pages by pressing 'space' where it view the content
in pages in forward mode if we press 'b' it shows content in pages in backward mode, if we press 'enter' we will traverse
in forward direction in single line, if we press q we will get out from less mode.
tail mode where it shows the last few lines of the file.
where 'head' mode will show few first lines of file.
