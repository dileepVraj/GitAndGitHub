We know that 'mv' command serves us to move folders and files into another folders, along with that we can also use
'mv' command to rename the folders/directories.

Suppose assume we have 2 folders in our present working directory 'apples', 'oranges' now we want to rename 'apples' to
'bananas' to do that we have to use the following command 'mv apples bananas' here what we are doing is we saying rename
apples with bananas.

That's it the folder with 'apples' will be now renamed with 'bananas'.
