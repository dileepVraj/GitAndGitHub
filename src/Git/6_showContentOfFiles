The commands we discuss in this section are all about to view content of files present in working directory, staging area
and local repository by using commit hash code.

1. To view content of files present in working directory there is one simple view we can view all files in one editor
called 'vim' by using following command.

'vim fileName'

The above command will open the specified file in vim editor where to edit file we have to enable insert mode by clicking
on 'i' after making changes to files we can save the changes and quit the editor by clicking escape button and clicking
':wq' and click enter this ':wq' meaning is write and quit the vim editor.

If we want to quit the vim editor without saving changes we made to the file type ':q!' and press enter.

If we want to set row numbers in vim editor first switch to normal mode and by pressing ':' enter into commandline mode
and enter ': set number' command we can enable row numbers to file in Vim editor.

If we want to off row number use ':set nonumber' command.

If we want to enable programming style to programming giles use ':syntax on' if want to off it use ':syntax off' commands.
