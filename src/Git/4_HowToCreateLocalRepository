To create local repository in our preferred working directory/folder in our local machine we have to run the 'git init'
command, This commands setup the necessary files and directories to start tracking changes and managing version control
for your project.
It creates '.git' directory at root of specified directory, which contains repository's metadata and objects.

Here are some tasks performed by 'git init' command during installation process.

1. creates the .git directory: The .git directory is the core of Git repository. It is a hidden directory that contains
all necessary files and folders to manage version control of the project.

2. Setup the repository structure: Within the '.git' directory git creates several subdirectories, such as 'objects',
'refers', 'hooks' and 'config'.
These directories store the repository data, hook scripts, and configuration settings, respectively.

3. Initializes the empty repository: by default the 'git init' initializes an empty repository with no commits or
branches.
It provides a clean slate to start tracking changes and recording your projects history.

4. Configures default settings: During initialization Git setups default configuration settings for the repository,
such as username and email address associated with commits.
You can modify these settings later using 'git config' command.

The 'git init' command typically runs once at beginning of a new project, to create a local git repository.
After initialization you can use other git commands like 'git add', 'git commit', 'git branch' to manage your project
version control and collaborate with others.

In summary 'git init' stands for initialize, and running this command setups a new Git repository in the specified
directory by creating the necessary files, directories and default configurations for version control.
