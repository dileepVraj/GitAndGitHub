In this section we are going to learn about 'git rm' command where we it is useful to remove files from working directory
and staging area.

1. To remove particular/specific file from working directory and staging area use 'git rm <fileName>' command.

Note: This command will not remove specific file it it is not committed after staged into the staged area.
If we want to remove the file which is not committed in staging area we first have to commit the changes and then we have
to use 'git rm <fileName> command.'


2. To remove all files from working directory and staging area use 'git rm -r --cached .' command.

3. To remove a particular file from staging area but not from working directory use 'git rm --cached <fileName> '
this command removes specified file from staging area even though it is not committed after staging to staging area after
making changes or modifications.

4. If we want to remove files from only working directory use 'rm <fileName>' where it removes file only from working
directory.
