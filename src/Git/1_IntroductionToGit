       Hello
     * Imagine you are working on a project with your friend, both of you want to make changes to same files.
     * Git is a super smart and organized assistant that helps you keep track of all changes you and your friend make.
     */

    /**
     * Here is how it works:
     -----------------------
     *
     * Starting a project:
      --------------------
      you and your friend create a repository using Git. Think of it as a special folder that holds
     * all your project folder.
     *
     * Making changes:
      ----------------
      You and your friend each can make changes to the files in the repo. Git keeps track of every
      change.
     * you make, like adding new code, modifying existing code and deleting files.
     *
     * Snapshots: Git takes snapshots every time you make changes to the files in project, it is like taking picture of
     * your project at the moment.
     * These snapshots are called commits in Git.
     *
     * Branches: Sometimes you and your friend want to work on different parts of same project at the same time.
     * Git allows you to create branches which are like separate paths for making changes.
     * Each branch keeps track of it's own set of commits.
     *
     * Merging changes: Git helps you to automatically merge the changes that you and your friend made on separate
       branches
     * making sure everything fits together nicely.
     *
     * Keeping history: Git only doesn't keep track of current version of project.
     * It also remembers every single change we made.
     * so if you made a mistake or want to go back to older version, Git can help you to easily find and replace it.
     *
     * Collaboration: Git makes it easy to work with your friend or even with whole team. you can share your repo with
       others, and they can contribute their changes too.
     * Git helps to manage all different changes and ensure that everyone's work is organized.
     *
